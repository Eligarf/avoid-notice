# PF2e Avoid Notice

A module for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com) that shows results of initiative stealth check vs combatant perception DCs on the initiative messages when *Begin Encounter* is clicked.

## Initiative messages
When *Begin Encounter* is clicked on the combat tracker, this module appends GM-visible results of checking the initiative stealth value against the non-allied combatants to the initiative roll message, grouped by detection status: `Unnoticed`, `Undetected`, `Hidden`, and `Observed`. The numbers by each listed token in the groups shows the difference between the stealth initiative roll and the perception DC of that token.

In the above, *Amiri's* stealth roll of 13 was successful against *monster* and *creature*, who had perception DC's of 10 and 13 and so *Amiri* is `Undetected` by them. The roll was not successful against *beast* or *grumpkin*, who in turn had perception DC's of 17 and 20, so *Amiri* is only `Hidden` against them. *PF2e Avoid Notice* will apply this bonus automatically if the token rolling stealth has an `Effect: Cover (Standard)` or `Effect: Cover (Greater)` effect on it unless *PF2e Perception* is active. 

An *Unnoticed* setting controls whether or not to use `Unnoticed` rather than `Undetected` for stealth checks that beat both the target's perception DC and initiative. `Undetected` is always used if the stealth initiative roll beats the target's perception DC but doesn't beat the target's initiative roll.

*PF2e Avoid Notice* also can remove the GM hidden states of combatants if enabled in the game settings, since forgetting to toggle combatant visibility happens to me too often.

## PF2e Perception
The 'Pathfinder on Foundry VTT Community and Volunteer Development Server' discord server leads to the excellent unlisted module [PF2e Perception](https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-perception). It isn't required for the overall operation of this module, but additional capabilities become available:

* *PF2e Avoid Notice* will set the appropriate visibility flags on the combatant tokens to reflect the detection status determined by stealth initiative checks.
* An *Override* setting allows *PF2e Avoid Notice* to override existing *PF2e Perception* visibility flags on tokens. Disabling this is useful if one wishes to setup any complicated situation beforehand and not get it stomped by the initiative rolls.
* IfÂ *PF2e Perception* cover flags are found on a token using stealth for initiative, standard or greater cover bonuses will apply as appropriate against perception DCs.
* If *Compute Cover at Combat Start* is selected, *`*PF2e Avoid Notice* will ignore existing cover flags and use *PF2e Perception* to calculate new ones for tokens using stealth as initiative for each token they are testing against
