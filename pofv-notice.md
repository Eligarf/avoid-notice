### PF2e Avoid Notice v13.7.1

- Some tweaks to `Use Unnoticed` option
  - If `Toggle on GM-Hidden combatants at Combat Start` is enabled, visibility won't be toggled on for a GM-hidden token if it remains `unnoticed` by _**all**_ PCs at combat start.
  - Actually put the word 'Use' in the option name.
  - Any `unnoticed` states will be treated as `undetected` when talking to _PF2e Visioner_.
  - Familiar and Eidolon tokens still show as `undetected`, since they don't have initiative rolls, but I'm adding a "?" to the delta string printed for that token on an avoider's initiative card to give a heads up to the GM that maybe it's unnoticed instead.
  - Fix hide-from-allies filter for familiars and eidolons
