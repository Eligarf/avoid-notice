### PF2e Avoid Notice v13.9.0

- v13 only. Add an opt-out client game setting to pan/zoom at combat start to include all tokens known to be in combat by that client, ignoring any foundry-hidden tokens, as well as any that are undetected or unnoticed to tokens controlled by that client. Feature requires socketlib. No more missing combatants because I was too zoomed in!
