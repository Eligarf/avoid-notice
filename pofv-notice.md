### PF2e Avoid Notice v13.7.4

- When using the 'Hide selected tokens' keybind, the generic hidden condition will be applied to any selected hazards. This lets _PF2e Visioner_ interact with the hazards as expected.
- If running on Foundry 13.347+, deprecate _PF2e Avoid Notice_ game setting to clear movement history at turn end since that is now standard system behavior.
- Update Polish Translation (thanks Lioheart)
