### PF2e Avoid Notice v13.9.0

- socketlib is now a required module.
- In v13 only, add an opt-out client game setting to pan/zoom at combat start to include all tokens known to be in combat by that client, ignoring any foundry-hidden tokens, and any that are undetected or unnoticed by tokens controlled by that client.
- No more missed combatants because I was zoomed in too close!
