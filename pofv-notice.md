- Use the bulk API switch to also control routing the clear stealth functions for visioner into its specific API call if enabled. Don't enable it unless you are testing functionality as these Visioner APIs are still baking.

- if enabled, toggle the visibility states of GM-hidden encounter tokens last to ensure visibility handlers have had a chance to set the visibility statuses.
- Update Polish Translation (thanks Lioheart)
